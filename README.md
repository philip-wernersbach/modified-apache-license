modified-apache-license
=======================

The Modified Apache License, for use with some of my projects.

The main changes to the Apache License that the Modified Apache License makes are:

1. Definition of who the Original Author is: While this is implied in the original Apache
   License, it is not explicitly stated. And in a court of law, common sense is not common,
   so I concretely defined who the Original Author is.

2. Preservation of License: The Modified Apache License requires that all Works and Derivative
   Works be licensed under the Modified Apache License also. Note that this does not ban closed source
   redistribution, as the Apache License explicitly allows that.
